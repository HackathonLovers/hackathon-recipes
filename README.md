# Hackathon Recipes

Have you ever participated in a hackathon?

## It just works!

You need to code real quick, and create things than can be seen in minutes. So, your motto should be: **it just works**

You probably have a few snippets that saved you a lot of time in the past. You probably share them using [gist](https://gist.github.com/). We just pretend to **put all these useful snippets in a repository, and keep them organized.**

## How to contribute?

Of course, you're free to use this snippets as you want. We've selected a [MIT license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) for the contents of the repo. And we will allow you to send any snippet you think can be useful for someone.

The only rules are:

* You send a fully functional code.
* If necessary, you include a readme.txt file, explaining important stuff (for example, if you need to install something additional to make the code work, if the code need access to a specific resource, etc).
* You feel comfortable with the MIT license for your code.
* You put your code in a folder, following the existing logic.

So, just clone this repo and do a pull request, or send us your snippet to <hackathonlovers@gmail.com>.

Happy coding!
